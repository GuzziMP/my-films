
Welcome to My Films !

The My Films plugin requires only a minimal setup to work.

Following installation My Films Setup will be launched to allow you to configure the plugin.

Although there are many options, most have been preset for you. You only need to enter the required information for a few fields (yellow fields) to begin using My Films. Tool Tips are available for all fields in Setup to assist you.

Please refer to our extensive My Films Wiki to learn all about the new features, advantages and ways to customize My Films to your preferences. A link to the Wiki appears on the bottom in My Films Setup and is visible on every page.

If you are updating your Ant Movie Catalog to the new version 4.x, please check the upgrade instructions in the My Films wiki how to migrate your watched status.

Enjoy!
